## 🎯 Overview

Sync AI is a self-healing network intelligence system that monitors live data streams, detects anomalies, predicts issues, and autonomously repairs network problems through GPU-accelerated simulation. Built for HackUTD 2025, Sync combines NVIDIA's multi-agent reasoning with real-time network monitoring to create a breakthrough in autonomous network management.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Monitoring** - Live network health and customer sentiment tracking
- **Anomaly Detection** - AI-powered detection of network issues before they impact users
- **Predictive Repair** - Simulation-driven repair planning with GPU acceleration
- **Autonomous Healing** - Self-healing network that fixes issues without human intervention
- **Interactive Dashboard** - Beautiful, responsive interface with real-time visualizations
- **Multi-Agent System** - Coordinated AI agents for sentiment analysis, technical detection, and simulation
