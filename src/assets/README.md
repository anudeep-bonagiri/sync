# Assets Directory

## Cat Icon Setup

Please save the cat image you provided (the white cat with pink cape holding a book) as:
`cat-icon.png`

The image should be placed in this directory (`src/assets/`).

The image has already been integrated into:
- `Hero.tsx` - Main hero section at the top
- `Footer.tsx` - Footer section at the bottom

Both locations previously used the lightning bolt (Zap) icon from lucide-react.
