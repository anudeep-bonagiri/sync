FAILED REMEDIATION ATTEMPTS

High-Profile Failures (Lessons Learned):

Failed Repair #1: Premature Traffic Restoration
- Incident: 2023-10-12
- Issue: Restored traffic before backend was fully recovered
- Result: Cascading failure, extended outage by 40 minutes
- Learning: Implement health check verification before restoration

Failed Repair #2: Incomplete Database Rollback
- Incident: 2023-09-05
- Issue: Schema rollback left orphaned records
- Result: Data integrity issues for 2,300 users
- Learning: Automated consistency checks post-rollback

Failed Repair #3: Over-Aggressive Auto-Scaling
- Incident: 2023-08-22
- Issue: Scaled up too quickly, overwhelmed database
- Result: Database connection exhaustion
- Learning: Rate-limited scaling actions

RECOMMENDED REPAIR PLAYBOOKS

Playbook: High Latency Response
1. Verify issue scope (regional vs. global)
2. Check backend health metrics
3. Analyze traffic patterns
4. If regional: Reroute traffic to healthy region
5. If global: Scale up compute resources
6. Monitor for 10 minutes post-remediation
7. If unresolved: Escalate to infrastructure team

Playbook: Service Unavailability
1. Check service health endpoints
2. Review recent deployments
3. Analyze error logs and metrics
4. If recent deployment: Rollback
5. If resource exhaustion: Scale up
6. If dependency failure: Activate backup systems
7. Verify full restoration before customer notification

Playbook: Data Inconsistency
1. Identify scope of inconsistency
2. Isolate affected systems
3. Prevent further writes if necessary
4. Analyze root cause (cache, replication lag, etc.)
5. Invalidate caches if applicable
6. Force replication sync if needed
7. Run data integrity verification
8. Gradual restoration with monitoring
